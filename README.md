## 🧪 Angular Vitest Lab

This repository is a **personal learning lab** where I will be adding different projects aimed at **learning and improving Angular testing skills**.

The learning path is progressive:  
I will start with small and simple projects and gradually move towards more complex applications, applying better testing strategies and best practices along the way.

### 🎯 Repository Goals

- Learn Angular testing from scratch.
- Practice unit and integration testing.
- Use Vitest as a modern testing framework for Angular.
- Document each project in a clear and reusable way.

### 📁 Project Structure

Each project in this repository will include the following sections:

1. **Project Description**  
   A brief explanation of the project goals and main features.

2. **Project Structure**  
   Overview of the folder structure and important files.

3. **Test Suites**  
   Description of the implemented test suites, what they cover, and the testing concepts being practiced.

### 📌 Projects

1. **TODO App**  
   **Project Description**
   A basic task management application designed to practice the fundamentals of Angular testing.
